# Inspiration
Have you ever hit a mental BufferOverflow? Spending countless hours in front of your screen, sifting through data, only to realize you're drowning in information beyond your brain's capacity? ðŸ¤¯
In our current era of information overload, researchers, professionals, and curious minds alike struggle not just with the sheer volume of data, but with identifying what's truly relevant. With an average of 250 academic articles read per researcher annually, the challenge isn't just in consuming this informationâ€”it's in effectively filtering through the noise to find the gems that matter. Often, this quest ends with valuable insights lost in isolation, making it difficult to see the big picture and connect the dots of our knowledge.
Our team has experienced first-hand the frustration of juggling disjointed tools. The critical missing piece? A way to not only manage but intelligently filter the flood of information to highlight what's relevant to our unique knowledge landscape.

# What It Does:
Dr. Clippy asks questions to gauge your knowledge by communicating with you through voice or text, identifies gaps, and suggests papers tailored to you from online searches. It then leverages spatial computing to build and visualize a 3D spatial mind map of your existing knowledge. The suggested papers are visually suggested as new nodes that connect to your knowledge graph, showing how new information connects to other papers you know so you can decide whether to read the suggested papers and expand on your knowledge. 
Hereâ€™s how Dr. Clippy stands out:
Personalized Discovery: Dr. Clippy recommends academic papers and resources tailored to your knowledge base and gaps.
Visual Knowledge Mapping: Dr. Clippy visualizes how new information slots into your existing knowledge, highlighting connections and sparking innovation through a spatial 3D mind map.
Collaborative and Interactive: Dr. Clippy is your AI assistant and research partner that you can talk to. Beyond solo research, Dr. Clippy enables shared knowledge building with your research colleagues. Edit, expand, and share collective wisdom in a mixed reality space powered by Apple Vision Pro.
